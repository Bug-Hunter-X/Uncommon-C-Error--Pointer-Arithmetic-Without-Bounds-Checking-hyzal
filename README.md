This repository showcases a common yet easily overlooked error in C programming involving pointer arithmetic and memory management.  The example demonstrates a scenario where a simple pointer operation leads to unexpected behavior. The bug is in accessing memory locations outside the valid bounds of the allocated memory. The solution corrects the issue by adding error checks and memory management best practices. For more complex programs, thorough testing and debugging are crucial for avoiding this type of bug.
